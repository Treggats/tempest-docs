It's been a little over a week since Tempest was released. It's great to see so many people have [joined the Discord server](/discord), created issues and feature requests, and sent PRs! Today we're tagging the first minor release which includes a range of bugfixes, as well as some new features. Let's take a look!

## Database seeders

This release adds support for [database seeders](/docs/essentials/database#database-seeders), which allow you to fill your database with dummy data for  local development. The only thing you need is a class implementing the {`\Tempest\Database\DatabaseSeeder`} interface, which Tempest will then discover:

```console
./tempest database:seed

 │ <em>Which seeders do you want to run?</em>
 │ / <dim>Filter...</dim>
 │ → ⋅ Tests\Tempest\Fixtures\MailingSeeder
 │   ⋅ Tests\Tempest\Fixtures\InvoiceSeeder
```

Note how you can create multiple seeders and select them when running the `database:seed` command. Multiple seeders are especially useful when you have larger applications where you want the ability to bring the database to specific states, depending on which feature you're working on.

Database seeding also works with the `migrate:fresh` command, supports multiple databases, and more. You can read all about them [here](/docs/essentials/database#database-seeders).

## Discovery improvements

We made an effort to [improve discovery performance](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1333), increasing non-cached and partial performance with ~30%. Together with [config cache improvements](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1341), running Tempest locally feels very snappy now. As a reference point, we used this documentation website, which now takes between 100ms and 200ms to load (it used to be between 400ms and 600ms). Keep in mind these numbers though may vary depending on your machine. Overall, there's a clear performance improvement though, and we're really happy with that.

If you happen to run into any issues after updating to 1.1, please let us know [on Discord](/discord) or [via GitHub](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework). The upgrade should be as easy as running `composer up`, but if you do encounter errors, we'd like to know so that we can fix them.

## Smaller features and bug fixes

There were also a bunch of smaller features and bug fixes added in this release:

- [A new `HexColor` validation rule](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1332)
- [A new session `reflash()` method](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1338)
- [The ability to only specify a port when running `tempest serve`](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1350)
- [Support implicit HEAD requests](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1349)
- [Fix log level-specific drivers](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1343)
- [Enable icon cache by default](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1339)
- [And more](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

## What's next?

We aim to release a new minor version every one to two weeks. We're currently working on the [new email component](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1227), [redis support](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1252), [a wrapper for symfony/process](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/pull/1326), discussing oauth support, and more. 

As always: you're welcome to join the Tempest community to help shape the future of the framework. The best place to start is by [joining our Discord server](/discord).
